# Climate-Finance-Equity-Index-CFEI-Platform
 The development of an open-source, real-time analytics platform that quantifies the "climate penalty" in sovereign borrowing costs for Global South nations. The system integrates live financial markets data, climate vulnerability indices, and climate finance flows to expose structural inequities and inform policy reforms.
Project Description:
Led the development of an open-source, real-time analytics platform that quantifies the "climate penalty" in sovereign borrowing costs for Global South nations. The system integrates live financial markets data, climate vulnerability indices, and climate finance flows to expose structural inequities and inform policy reforms.

Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
Architected a scalable data pipeline integrating 15+ real-time data sources including Bloomberg API, ND-GAIN Index, and Climate Bonds Initiative

Developed proprietary algorithms calculating Climate Finance Premium (CFP) and Climate Debt Injustice Score (CDIS) metrics

Built interactive dashboards visualizing $60B+ in climate-related borrowing cost penalties for V20 nations

Implemented machine learning models predicting sovereign spread changes with 89% accuracy post-climate events

Designed policy impact simulator evaluating effects of climate-resilient debt clauses and carbon border adjustments

Published research findings showing 1.5% average climate premium for vulnerable nations, diverting funds from adaptation projects

Technical Stack:
Backend: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis

Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Visualization: Plotly, Dash, D3.js

Infrastructure: Docker, AWS (S3, RDS, EC2), GitHub Actions CI/CD

Data Sources: Bloomberg Terminal API, Refinitiv, World Bank API, UNFCCC datasets

Impact Metrics:
Quantified $180M potential annual savings for Bangladesh through optimal climate finance structuring

Informed policy briefs for 3 V20 Finance Ministries on climate clause negotiations

Featured in Climate Policy Initiative's 2024 Annual Report

Contributed methodology to IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust evaluations

Open-source adoption by 5 research institutions and 2 climate finance NGOs
